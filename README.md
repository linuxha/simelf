This is the code for the SimElf++ COSMAC ELF (CDP1802) Emulator

# Description

COSMAC ELF-ish CDP1802 Simulator in JavaScript (SimElf++)

William Donneelly's SimElf++ COSMAC ELF emulator. Found on http://www.donnelly-house.net/programming/cdp1802/simelf/ I haven't contacted the author but the files say GPLv3 so that's the license applied. While running the code I found out that it doesn't really work. Poking around I found some errors that we easy to fix (renaming errors) and some not so easy (missing files). I'm posting the code here in the hope that I can either fix or contact the author and see if he has working code. Since he wrote it in 2011, I'm not holding out too much hope.

My reason for wanting this to work is that I have a Vintage Dage Scientific Model MC-3 1802 development board. Since it's only part of a complete system I'm left guessing how to interface to it. So far I've read the rom and I hope to disassemble it to figure out how to use the RJ13 (?) connector to communicate with it. I've not found out much on the 'net other than an obscure reference to a April and May article from Radio-Electronics. So far I haven't found the article.
